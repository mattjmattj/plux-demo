# plux : demo

This demo is a very basic TODO list application
See it as a POC implementation, involving a micro web framework based on [plux](https://github.com/mattjmattj/plux).

You can use this demo as a source of inspiration if you are planning of building
a one-direction flow-based architecture around [plux](https://github.com/mattjmattj/plux)
or by yourself.

## installation

```
composer update
```

## execution

The easiest way to get the demo running is to run `php -S localhost:8080`, but you can
also clone the project in the root folder of your Apache2 server for instance.
